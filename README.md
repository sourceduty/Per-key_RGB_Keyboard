A software application controls each LED backlight for every mechanical key on an RGB computer keyboard. This open-source application can illuminate individual keys to indicate the order in which the user needs to press each key.

### Instructional

Game developers can use this application to guide players with per-key instructions for spelling in-game words and short sentences. Additionally, educational typing software can employ this application to provide per-key instructions, assisting users in learning simple spelling.

Some of the software utilities that could integrate this open-source application include Corsair iCUE, OpenRGB, Project Aurora, and SignalRGB.

### Gaming Mode (Active)

Adding a gaming mode for WASD keys would enhance the application by allowing users to highlight these specific keys, often used for movement in games. This mode would illuminate the WASD keys, making them stand out during gameplay and providing a more immersive and intuitive experience for gamers.
