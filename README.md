### Instructional

Game developers can use this application to guide players with per-key instructions for spelling in-game words and short sentences. Additionally, educational typing software can employ this application to provide per-key instructions, assisting users in learning simple spelling.

#
### Gaming Mode

Adding a gaming mode for WASD keys would enhance the application by allowing users to highlight these specific keys, often used for movement in games. This mode would illuminate the WASD keys, making them stand out during gameplay and providing a more immersive and intuitive experience for gamers.

### Hardware

The hardware required for implementing a per-key RGB keyboard controller involves several key components. Firstly, an RGB mechanical keyboard with individually addressable LED backlights for each key is essential. These keyboards are equipped with LEDs that can be controlled separately, allowing for dynamic lighting patterns and specific key illumination. Additionally, a microcontroller capable of handling multiple LED outputs is necessary to manage the complex lighting sequences. This microcontroller processes the commands from the software and translates them into precise lighting instructions for each key.

Furthermore, a robust communication interface between the keyboard and the computer is required to ensure seamless data transfer. This typically involves a USB interface that supports high-speed data communication, allowing real-time updates to the key lighting. Alongside the hardware, compatible software utilities like Corsair iCUE, OpenRGB, Project Aurora, and SignalRGB are essential for customizing and controlling the lighting effects. These utilities provide the necessary drivers and user interfaces to program the lighting sequences, ensuring the per-key RGB functionality operates smoothly and efficiently.
